The world spins slow

When the disco lights glow on her face





My head's in a haze,

Endless eupohoria 

Illuminating our slippery skin







Fingers dance 

But sometimes they bruise my skin amidst

The naked romance you're dreaming of, 

Heaven's we're created by apes ???












The melodies, they skip and repeat

In a room full of other worldly virtues














In silence we sleep with photographic -

neurons going off carelessly to the moon











Can't help but be blown away

Goose bumps everytime I breathe

Baby disco lights aren't only for us -

to dance underneath









Can't help but be blown away

Goose bumps everytime I breathe

Baby disco lights aren't only for us -

to dance underneath








The shapes of our minds

Colored in times

And held by the reels of memories ???




























Moonlight bending through the -

walls of Mount pleasent 

Embracing her arms, I lay still and rested 











My heart's wrapped in an electric blanket 

My mind's whosed beside the ghost firework ???














She paints her eyes in disco light

And I'm waiting to be understood











The melodies, they skip and repeat

In a room full of other worldly virtues












In silence we sleep with photographic - 

neurons going off carelessly to the moon











Can't help but be blown away

Goose bumps everytime I breathe

Baby disco lights aren't only for us to dance underneath










Can't help but be blown away

Goose bumps everytime I breathe

Baby disco lights aren't only for us to dance on the knees 











The shapes of our minds

Colored in time

And held by the reels of memories ???
