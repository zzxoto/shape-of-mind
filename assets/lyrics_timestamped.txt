15:00
The world spins slow
When the disco lights glow on her face

15:08
My head's in a haze endless eupohoria 
Illuminating our slippery skin

15:20
Fingers dance 
But sometimes they bruise my skin amidst 
The naked romance you're dreaming of, 
Heaven's we're created by apes ???

15:40
The melodies, they skip and repeat
In a room full of other worldly virtues
In silence we sleep, with photographic neurons going off carelessly to the moon

16:10
Can't help but be blown away
Goose bumps everytime I breathe
Baby disco lights aren't only for us to dance underneath

16:25
Can't help but be blown away
Goose bumps everytime I breathe
Baby disco lights aren't only for us to dance underneath

16:40
The shapes of our minds
Colored in times
And held by the reels of memories ???

17:15
Moonlight bending through the walls of Mount pleasent 
Embracing her arms, I lay still and rested 

17:30
My heart's wrapped in an electric blanket 
My mind's whosed beside the ghost firework ???

17:47
She paints her eyes in disco light
And I'm waiting to be understood

18:01
The melodies, they skip and repeat
In a room full of other worldly virtues

18:16
In silence we sleep
With photographic neurons going off carelessly to the moon

18:31
Can't help but be blown away
Goose bumps everytime I breathe
Baby disco lights aren't only for us to dance underneath

18:46
Can't help but be blown away
Goose bumps everytime I breathe
Baby disco lights aren't only for us to dance on the knees 

19:01
The shapes of our minds
Colored in time
And held by the reels of memories ???
